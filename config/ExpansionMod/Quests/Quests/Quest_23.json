        "Survivor, I'm Arvandus Metalsmith, collector of rare metals. I need your help gathering precious ingots—charcoal, sulfur, copper, diamonds, gold, iron, silver, tin—all scattered across this unforgiving landscape. These metals are essential for crafting roofs, bullets, computers, and more. All needed for the fight against the hordes of undead, and the ungrateful living. Hunt down these ingots and bring them to me. Your efforts will be richly rewarded, and our camp's capabilities will grow stronger in this challenging world. Begin your Metallic Pursuit now!"
