        "Survivor, our situation is dire, and we need every resource at our disposal. I have a task for you, a hazardous one. I need you to collect five pox grenades. These vile creations have been wreaking havoc, but within their toxicity lies an opportunity. Bring them to me, and I'll study their effects. There's a chance we can unravel their composition, understand their mechanism, and potentially create a cure or antidote. It's a risky venture, but the potential payoff could save lives. Head out, be cautious, and retrieve those pox grenades. Our hopes for a remedy rest on your shoulders."
